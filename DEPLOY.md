# Deploying the hosted demo

Both halves run on Vercel's free Hobby plan. Nothing here costs money.

Live: web https://antidote-bay.vercel.app, API https://antidote-api.vercel.app (OpenAPI at https://antidote-api.vercel.app/docs).

## API as a Vercel Python function

The FastAPI app is served by Vercel's Python runtime (Fluid compute, 300 second max duration, 2 GB memory), which is enough for the Nemotron 3 Ultra audit step (about 15 to 25 seconds end to end).

Files that make this work, all at the repo root:

- `index.py`: the entrypoint Vercel looks for. It puts `apps/api` and `packages/*` on `sys.path` and exposes `app`.
- `vercel.json`: declares the single FastAPI service and its entrypoint, and routes every path to it.
- `requirements.txt`: the runtime-only dependency list (the full `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` are excluded by `.vercelignore` so the bundle stays small).
- `.vercelignore`: keeps the web app, corpus PDFs, docs, tests and local databases out of the upload.
- `packages/core/antidote_core/paths.py`: on Vercel the bundle is read-only, so the index and seed records are copied to `/tmp` on first request. The ledger, API keys, register rows and uploads live there for the life of the instance. Set `ANTIDOTE_DATA_DIR` to point at persistent storage if you need durability.

Deploy from the repo root:

```
vercel link --yes --project antidote-api
grep '^NEBIUS_API_KEY=' ../.env | cut -d= -f2- | vercel env add NEBIUS_API_KEY production
grep '^TAVILY_API_KEY=' ../.env | cut -d= -f2- | vercel env add TAVILY_API_KEY production
echo 30 | vercel env add ANTIDOTE_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MIN production
vercel deploy --prod --yes
```

Set `ANTIDOTE_REQUIRE_KEY=1` as well if you want every `/v1/*` call to carry an `X-API-Key` minted by `POST /v1/keys`.

## Web on Vercel (Next.js)

The web app is its own Vercel project with Root Directory `apps/web`. Because the repo root is also linked (to the API project), the CLI must be told which project to target when deploying from `apps/web`:

```
cd apps/web
VERCEL_ORG_ID=team_DpFHpLDAlHwwTjTMWbQ0D2CP VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=prj_kd9RYxqdsBaT2Fy7D8w7iXcAdhzT vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE production   # paste https://antidote-api.vercel.app
VERCEL_ORG_ID=team_DpFHpLDAlHwwTjTMWbQ0D2CP VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=prj_kd9RYxqdsBaT2Fy7D8w7iXcAdhzT vercel deploy --prod --yes
```

Put the two variables inline on each command rather than exporting them. Without them the CLI resolves the nearest git-root link and overwrites the API project with the web build; if they stay exported, the next API deploy from the repo root lands on the web project instead. After any deploy, check both hosts: `curl -I https://antidote-api.vercel.app/health` and the web root should both return 200.

Locally `apps/web/.env.local` keeps `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://localhost:8010`.

## Keeping it warm during judging

Vercel functions cold-start in one to two seconds and need no keep-alive. If the API ever moves to a host that sleeps, a Hermes cron job (`hermes cron create "*/10 * * * *" --no-agent --script ping_api.py`) or any uptime monitor pointed at `/health` keeps it awake.

## Alternative: Docker on Render

`render.yaml` and `apps/api/Dockerfile` still describe the API as a Docker web service for Render's free tier (verified image build). Free Render services sleep after 15 minutes idle and cold-start in about 30 seconds.
